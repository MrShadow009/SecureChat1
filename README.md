# Real-Time-Secure-Chat-Application

## Introduction:
This project is a real-time secure chat application with a premium outer-space themed web UI, similar to WhatsApp & Signal with end-to-end encryption support. The project covers:
-	WebSocket Programming with Flask-SocketIO
-	Real-Time Multi-User Chat
-	Passphrase-Protected Rooms with Crypto Algorithm Selection

## Features:
-	Multi-User group chat rooms
-	Passphrase-protected room creation and joining
-	Users can choose between encryption algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, DES, PQC-KEM)
-	Premium outer-space themed UI with glass panels, starfield, and neon accents
-	Real-time participant lists and message broadcasting
-	Responsive web interface for multiple devices/tabs

## Technology Stack:
-	Python as the server-side language
-	Flask web framework with Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication
-	HTML/CSS/JS for responsive UI
-	Passlib for secure passphrase hashing
